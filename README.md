project title: face_recognation
The Face Recognition System is an application that uses advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to detect and recognize faces in images or video streams. It can identify individuals based on their unique facial features and is often used in security, authentication, and user interaction applications. This project utilizes various libraries such as OpenCV, dlib, and face_recognition for real-time face detection and recognition.

Prerequisites: 
Python 3.x (Recommended: Python 3.7+)
PIP (Python Package Installer)


Required Libraries:
OpenCV: For image and video processing.
dlib: For facial feature extraction and recognition.
face_recognition: A wrapper for dlib to make face recognition simpler.
numpy: For numerical operations

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

    pip install opencv-python dlib face_recognition numpy

Installation:

1) Clone the repository:

        git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-recognition.git
            cd face-recognition

2) Install dependencies:

         pip install -r requirements.txt

3) (Optional) Install CMake if it's not installed (required for dlib):

          sudo apt-get install cmake
